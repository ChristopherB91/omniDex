This is my Omnidex app. There are six presets, each with ten aliens. Every alien from the show that was able to transform into an ultimate alien can go ultimate here. When you open it up, first select which preset you would like, then press the Omnitrix button. Next, select an alien from the preset and click on the Omnitrix button again. When you are shown a picture of the alien, you can click the red Omnitrix to go back to the beginning. Depending on which alien you have chosen, you may be able to go ultimate. There is a seventh preset in this version. Within the seventh preset, you can create, read, update, and delete alien data you have added to the Omnidex.
