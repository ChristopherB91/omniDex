This is my Omnidex app. There are sixth presets each with ten aliens. Every alien from the show that was able to transform into an ultimate alien is able to go ultimate here. When you open it up first select which preset you would like then press the omnitrix button. Next select an alien from the preset and click on the omnitrix button again. When you are shown a picture of the alien you can click the red ommnitrix to go back to the beginning. Depending on which alien you have chosen you maybe able to go ultimate. There is a seventh preset in this version. Within the 7th preset you are able to create, read, update, and delete alien data you have added to the omnidex.
